# IS-201-Final-Project-SORISAN
This is my final project for my IS 201 course. It contains a professional site, a site about hobbies, a small web app site, and other scratch pages. Each of these were created from a blank HTML file, and some of them collaborated with AI for efficiency and aesthetics. Please enjoy and feel free to look around!
